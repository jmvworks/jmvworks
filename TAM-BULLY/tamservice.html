                <h2>ABOUT THE SYSTEM</h2>
                <p>
                    This project aims to raise awareness about the harmful effects of bullying and provide a secure platform for victims to report incidents, while also promoting an anti-bullying community. The system offers a safe, anonymous space for both victims and bystanders to report bullying, ensuring that individuals can come forward without fear of retaliation. By raising awareness and encouraging active participation, the system helps build a more inclusive and respectful community where bullying is not tolerated.

                <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
                <p>
                    The system will create a safer and more supportive environment by providing individuals with an accessible and anonymous way to report bullying, ensuring that their voices are heard without fear of retaliation. The system will also include educational resources and real-time support for victims, helping them navigate the process and find the assistance they need. The development process will take 3-6 days to complete, beginning with careful planning to outline the systemâ€™s key features and functionality.

                <h2>WHY REPORTING MATTERS</h2>
                <p>
                    Reporting bullying helps prevent further harm and protects the victim from continued abuse. It allows authorities to take appropriate action and address the issue promptly. It also raises awareness, encouraging others to speak up and stand against bullying. By speaking up, we contribute to building a culture of respect and support for everyone.
